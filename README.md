**Why a calculator?**
- I searched and considered various different projects, including a piano, but decided on a calculator as I thought it was a little more relevant to me as a person

**What went wrong?**
- Picking the wrong language
- Inability to push to git from command lime
- Leading on from previous: devDependencies

**What I enjoyed?**
- Learning the new language
- Working through the issues, and errors
- The overall challenge
